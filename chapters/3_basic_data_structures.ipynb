Sometimes these ends are referred to as the “left” and the “right” or in some cases the “front” and the “rear.” You could also call them the “top” and the “bottom”. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur.\n"

    "# What is a Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place *at the same end*. This end is commonly referred to as the “top”. The end opposite the top is known as the “base”.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ordering principle is sometimes called **LIFO**, last-in first-out. It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.\n",

    "Stacks are fundamentally important, as they can be used to reverse the order of items. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.\n",
